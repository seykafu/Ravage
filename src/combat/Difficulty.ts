// Per-battle difficulty bump applied at unit-instantiation time.
//
// Design intent — the original B1-B13 enemy stats were tuned to be
// approachable for new players in roughly the order they'd be played.
// Once the campaign filled out, B2-B13 felt a touch easy for a player
// who'd internalized stances + AP + the weapon triangle. This module
// applies a small global stat bump to every battle EXCEPT the tutorial
// (B1 — the palace coup, where the player's about to lose by design
// regardless of mechanics).
//
// Why not just edit each battle's enemy roster? Two reasons:
//   * Centralizing the knob means a future "easy / normal / hard"
//     difficulty selector lives in exactly one place, not 30.
//   * It cleanly opts B1 out without scattering "if (battleId === ...)"
//     guards through the data layer.
//
// Bosses are NOT bumped — they're already tuned to be the hardest part
// of their respective fights, and stacking +HP on a boss who already
// holds position until the squad has thinned the guards turns the
// closing minute of every battle into a slog.
//
// Future: a `DIFFICULTY_PROFILES` map keyed off save.difficulty (when
// that lands) will replace the simple is-tutorial check.

// ---- Level scaling -----------------------------------------------------------
//
// Enemy factories author stats against a REFERENCE level
// (UnitDef.statReferenceLevel — e.g. the Royal Guard's 30 HP was tuned
// for L6). Battles field those same factories at much higher authored
// levels, but until this pass the LEVEL only fed XP math — so a L16
// guard fought with a L6 statline while the squad arrived with sixteen
// levels of compounded growth and a promotion. The measured result
// (see BalanceSim + BalanceReport): from B12 onward, enemies needed
// 40-80 swings to kill a player. The war had no teeth.
//
// The scaling below grants per-level gains for every level above the
// reference, at rates tuned against the simulated campaign curve so
// rank-and-file stay killable in ~2-4 focused swings while genuinely
// threatening the squad, and bosses keep out-pressuring their escorts.
// Rates are per level; totals are rounded once at the end so partial
// gains accumulate instead of vanishing.
