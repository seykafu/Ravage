// ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// ObliqueProjection — the tilted ¾ "diorama" view (HD-2D plan, Approach C).
//
// The camera pitches down over the board instead of looking straight down.
// Three things follow from that, and together they are most of what makes
// a flat tactics grid read as a physical place:
//
//   1. FORESHORTENING. A tile's top face is `tileW` wide but only `tileH`
//      tall (tileH < tileW). The ground visibly recedes.
//   2. ELEVATION. Each tile has an integer height in levels. A raised tile
//      is drawn `elevation * elevStep` world pixels HIGHER on screen, so a
//      plateau stands up off the ground and a riverbed sinks into it.
//   3. SIDE FACES. Wherever a tile is higher than the tile in front of it
//      (the row below it on screen), the drop between them is a visible
//      south-facing wall. The whole board also sits on a slab whose front
//      edge shows as the base of the diorama.
//
// Crucially the grid stays AXIS-ALIGNED. A tile's top face is still a
// rectangle — just a shorter one, lifted by its elevation. That is why this
// projection was chosen over a rotated isometric diamond: every overlay in
// the game (move range, threat zones, target brackets, path preview) keeps
// drawing axis-aligned rectangles; it only needs `topFace()` instead of
// assuming a TILE_SIZE square. Maps keep their authored orientation, and
// "left/right facing" keeps meaning left/right on screen.
//
// Pure: no Phaser import, so the whole thing — including input picking
// through elevated terrain — is unit-tested in Node.
